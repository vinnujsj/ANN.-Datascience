# Neural Network


## Description  
This repository contains an implementation of a **Neural Network** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The project demonstrates the architecture, training process, and evaluation of a simple feed-forward neural network for binary classification tasks.  

## Features  
- Input Layer, Hidden Layers, and Output Layer  
- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy  
- Training with Backpropagation  
- Model Evaluation on Test Data  

## Files  
- `neural_network.py` → Main implementation code  
- `README.md` → Project description  

## Results  
- The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset.  
- Demonstrates how Neural Networks can learn **non-linear patterns** effectively.  

## Learning Outcome  
Through this assignment, I gained hands-on knowledge of:  
- Neural Network architecture and working  
- Forward & backward propagation  
- Optimization techniques  
- Practical use of TensorFlow/Keras for building ML models
